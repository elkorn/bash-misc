    42              The DNA sequence is composed of genomic sequence, primarily
    43              finished clones that were sequenced as part of the Human Genome
    44              Project. PCR products and WGS shotgun sequence have been added
    45              where necessary to fill gaps or correct errors. All such additions
    46              are manually curated by GRC staff. For more information see:
